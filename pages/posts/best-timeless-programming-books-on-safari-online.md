I'm not a massive reader of technical programming books with loads of code in them as I find they are pretty much out of date as soon as they are published.  However, I am still a fan of those timeless programming books that never seem to go out of date and the information is always relevant.  

### Books

<details>
           <summary>Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software : Eric Evans</summary>
           <p>Great book if you are starting to transition from a mid to senior programmer with any input into making decisions.</p>
         </details>

<details>
           <summary>The Clean Coder : Robert C.
 Martin (uncle bob)</summary>
           <p>Stories are really engaging and not too long a read.</p>
         </details>

<details>
           <summary>The Mythical Man-Month, Essays on software engineering : Frederick P. Brooks Jr.</summary>
           <p>Bit old, some of it irrelevant but mostly still true all these years later</p>
         </details>

<details>
           <summary>The Pragmatic Programmer :
 David Thomas, Andrew Hunt</summary>
           <p>Probably one of easiest to read books on the list.  Broken down into sections on things you should be doing.  Everyone should read this,
 my favourite</p>
