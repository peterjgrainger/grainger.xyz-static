  title: 6 best developer podcasts on the internet right now

You don't know what you don't know. Apart from going to a conference the best
way to find out about cool new features of your favourite programming language
is to listen to podcasts while you walk to work or go to the gym.

Over the last year I've been on the lookout for the best podcasts on the
interweb for software engineers. I've been through a few painful hours listening
to crap so you don't have to. I would suggest mixing up technical and story
style podcasts as it's easy to loose enthusiasm if only listening to the
technical ones.

## Technical
The following are podcasts that focus on particular technologies and go into
detail of there main attributes and where / when you would use it. The format of
the shows usually involve getting a well known guest from the relevant community
and asking questions that would otherwise have taken much asking around and
probably some false answers.

### changelog [https://changelog.com/]
The changelog [https://changelog.com/]  covers a wide range of software
engineering topics including crypto currency (Bitcoin [https://bitcoin.org/en/],
 Ethereum [https://www.ethereum.org/], etc), docker, rabbitMQ but mainly focuses
on web technologies and open source software. The changelog banner includes 6
different podcasts focusing on different areas of software engineering but all
shows are really informal and one, jsParty [https://changelog.com/jsparty]  is
recorded live on Fridays so you can listen along and join the Slack channel to
give your comments as they talk, which I think is novel and unique in this
space. The original changelog [https://changelog.com/podcast]  is still the best
in my eyes as it covers things I didn't know existed. If you want all of the
podcasts there is a master [https://changelog.com/master]  with everything in!

### Software Engineering Radio [http://www.se-radio.net/]
Software Engineering Radio [http://www.se-radio.net/]  has been around for a
while, (January 2006!) and has quite a wide focus on different technologies.
Rather than focus on just software there are shows on good practices in software
engineering, compilers, DevSecOps.

The quality is always consistently high and I like the format of multiple hosts
sharing the responsibility of hosting the show.

### Devchat.tv [https://devchat.tv/]
Devchat.tv [https://devchat.tv/]  is a series of podcasts by the legend that is 
Charles Max Wood [https://twitter.com/cmaxw]. I'm heavily into javascript
development so I haven't missed an episode of jsJabber
[https://devchat.tv/js-jabber]  since I started listening and adventures in
Angular [https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular]  is also a great way to find out
about features you might not know about in Angular. The other podcasts in the
series focus on other technologies which you can view here [https://devchat.tv/]

### Hanselminutes [https://hanselminutes.com/]
Hanselminutes [https://hanselminutes.com/]  has been going for a long time and
is slightly different than the previous podcasts as it takes a more
conversational route to get to the core of a topic. The format is goes along the
route of finding out the story behind an idea and what original problem it was
trying to solve rather than the detail of the implementation.

## Non Technical
These podcasts don't cover a specific technical subject but give you the back
story of developer who has "Made it" which gives (me at least) lots of
motivation.

###Â Developer on fire [http://developeronfire.com/]
I've listened to pretty much every one of Dave Rael's podcasts on Developer on
fire [http://developeronfire.com/]  and he maintains a consistency and quality
that is probably a cut above the rest. He has had past and current greats such
as Robert Martin (uncle Bob)
[https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/], Tom Glib
[https://www.gilb.com/], John Papa [https://johnpapa.net/]  and loads more.

### 2 Frugal Dudes [http://2frugaldudes.com/]
2 Frugal Dudes [http://2frugaldudes.com/]  is a money focused show by two
software developers focusing on how to use your finances wisely. This one is a
new one to me but it has some great tips on how to maximise your income.
