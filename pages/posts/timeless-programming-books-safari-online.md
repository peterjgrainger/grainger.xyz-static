I'm not a massive reader of technical programming books with loads of code in
them as I find they are pretty much out of date as soon as they are published.
However, I am still a fan of those timeless programming books that never seem to
go out of date and the information is always relevant.

Books
Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software : Eric Evans
 Great book if you are starting to transition from a mid to senior programmer
with any input into making decisions.

The Clean Coder : Robert C.
Martin (uncle bob)
 Stories are really engaging and not too long a read.

The Mythical Man-Month, Essays on software engineering : Frederick P. Brooks Jr.

 Bit old, some of it irrelevant but mostly still true all these years later

The Pragmatic Programmer :
David Thomas, Andrew Hunt
 Probably one of easiest to read books on the list. Broken down into sections on
things you should be doing. Everyone should read this,
my favourite

Pragmatic Thinking and Learning :
Andy Hunt
 Recommended to me, not read yet

The practice of Programming: Rob Pike, Brian W. Kernighan
 Recommended to me, not read yet

Coders at Work: Reflections on the craft of programming:
Rob Pike, Brian W. Kerninghan
 Recommended to me, not read yet
